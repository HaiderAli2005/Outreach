database is unreachable).

## Added during the frontend build

| Method | Path | Auth | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/onboarding/answers` | org owner/admin, AI rate limit | Used when the site can't be read. Builds the facts and buyer groups from three answers (sell, who, countries). |
| GET | `/onboarding/market?refresh=1` | org member | Apollo counts per buyer group (all and verified emails) plus a 25 person sample per group. Cached 24h per set of enabled groups. |
| POST | `/organizations` | signed in, no organization needed | Creates a workspace (and starts setup when a domain is given). Up to 5 owned workspaces per user. |
| POST | `/webhooks/smartlead/:orgToken` | the organization's webhook token | Per-tenant URL. Events for a campaign that belongs to another organization are ignored. |

`/webhooks/calendly/:orgToken` and `/webhooks/apollo/:orgToken` also accept the organization token alone,
so tenants can configure them without the platform secret. `GET /organizations/current` hides the webhook
token from `MEMBER` users.

# Feature map

Every feature found in `outreach-saas` (server controllers, libs, jobs, client pages, scripts) and where it
lives in the rebuild. Status markers: `[ ]` not started, `[~]` in progress / partial, `[x]` complete
end-to-end (UI → API → validation → service → database → integration → UI update).

Paths: web routes are under `apps/web/src/app`, API routes under `/api/v1`.

---

## Authentication and access

### Sign in / sign out / session check  `[x]`
Existing: `users-controller` login, logindetails, logout (plaintext passwords, 7-day JWT cookie, in-memory throttle, no signup).
New: web `/signin`, onboarding step 1 · API `/auth/login`, `/auth/logout`, `/auth/refresh`, `/auth/me` · DB `User`, `RefreshToken` · bcrypt hashes, short-lived access JWT, rotating refresh cookie, Redis/memory rate limit, constant-time failure path.

### Registration  `[x]`
Existing: none (logins created by `scripts/add-user.js`). Required for a SaaS.
New: onboarding step 1 "Create account" · `/auth/register` · creates `User` + `Organization` + `OWNER` membership in one transaction.

### Google OAuth 2.0  `[x]`
Existing: none (design shows "Continue with Google").
New: `/auth/oauth/google/start` → `/auth/oauth/google/callback` (authorization code + PKCE + state) · `OAuthAccount`. Returns 503 when Google credentials are not configured.

### Team members and roles  `[x]`
Existing: several logins sharing one workspace (single tenant).
New: `/app/settings` Team tab · `/organizations/current/members` (list, invite by email, change role, remove) · `Membership` with `OWNER | ADMIN | MEMBER`. Invites create a pending membership + one-time token (`/auth/accept-invite`).

---

## Onboarding (design flow) mapped to existing functionality

### Domain analysis (brand research)  `[x]`
Existing: `POST /config/brand-setup` → `libs/brand.researchBrand` (site scrape + AI ICP).
New: landing hero + onboarding step 2 · `/onboarding/analysis` · `Onboarding` (summary, ICP chips), site scrape + OpenAI JSON. Without an AI key the step shows an error with Retry and allows entering the audience manually.

### Free sequence preview  `[x]`
Existing: `followups.buildSequence`, `personalize` (first email + 2 follow-ups).
New: onboarding step 3 · `/onboarding/preview` · generated from the saved analysis with OpenAI; cached on `Onboarding.preview`.

### Daily volume and plan  `[x]`
Existing: `default_daily_send_cap`, `per_mailbox_daily_cap`, credit caps.
New: onboarding step 4 + landing pricing · `/billing/plans` · `Plan` table (Launch/Growth/Scale), sizing rules (40 sends per warm inbox).

### Sending domains  `[~]`
Existing: none (source used pre-bought Smartlead mailboxes).
New: onboarding step 5 · `/onboarding/domains/ideas` (lookalike generator + real DNS lookup to flag registered names) · `SendingDomain`. Registration itself needs a registrar integration that neither source provides; purchased domains are stored as `PENDING_REGISTRATION` and shown as such. Documented in `migration-plan.md`.

### Inboxes and warmup plan  `[~]`
Existing: Smartlead mailbox listing + attach (`/smartlead/mailboxes`, `/smartlead/provision`).
New: onboarding step 6 · `Mailbox` rows per domain with warmup length · Settings → Sending lists real Smartlead mailboxes and attaches them. Creating Google/Microsoft inboxes is not in either source and stays `PENDING` until an inbox provider is integrated.

### Payment  `[x]`
Existing: none.
New: onboarding step 7 + `/app/billing` · `/billing/checkout` (Stripe subscription, `default_incomplete`, PaymentElement confirmation) · `Subscription`, `Payment`, `Invoice` rows synced from webhooks.

### Launch  `[x]`
Existing: `/smartlead/provision` (create campaign → sequence → schedule → settings → attach mailboxes → webhook → START).
New: onboarding step 8 · `/onboarding/launch` · creates the first `Campaign` from the analysis and provisions it in Smartlead when a key and mailboxes are available; otherwise reports exactly which prerequisite is missing.

New: `/app` · `/dashboard/cockpit` (tenant-scoped aggregates).

### Sidebar badges  `[x]`
Existing: `GET /dashboard/nav-counts`.
New: rail badges · `/dashboard/nav-counts`, polled every 45 s by RTK Query.

### Emergency stop / start  `[x]`

New: cockpit engine card · `/engine/stop`, `/engine/start`.

---

## Inbox

### Conversation list with Needs reply / Replied / Sent / All filters and AI-class filter  `[x]`
Existing: `GET /inbox` + shared `libs/needsReply`.

Existing: `GET /inbox/:id`.
New: `/app/inbox?thread=` · `/inbox/:contactId`.

New: `/inbox/:contactId/reply`.

### Deal closed / Mark handled / Remove person  `[x]`
Existing: `POST /inbox/:id/deal-closed`, `/handled`, `DELETE /inbox/:id`.

New: tenants create a campaign at launch and can create more from a saved audience (`POST /campaigns`); editing targeting is allowed only while `DRAFT` or `PAUSED`, which keeps the source's protection of a running campaign's state.

## Maintenance scripts from the source (`server/scripts`)

The 40 one-off scripts (probe-apollo, repair-*, backfill-*, seed-inbox-demo, verify-cutover-state…) were
operational repairs for one production database. They are not features and are not ported. `add-user.js`
is replaced by registration and invites. `run-migrations.js` is replaced by `prisma migrate deploy`.
